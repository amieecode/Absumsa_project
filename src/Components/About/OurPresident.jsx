            "Together, our diverse and driven council pushes for transformative change, extending
            our influence beyond the confines of Harvardâ€™s marble walls. We work tirelessly to
            promote student wellness, improve affiliations with community organizations, and organize
            events to bring our 200-person family together. All that we do is in pursuit of our
            central mission: to advance ABSUMSA into a realm where not only learning but also
            service and well-being are elevated to their utmost excellence."
